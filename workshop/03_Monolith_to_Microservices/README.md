# Monolith to Microservices 

![ticketmonster](assets/ticketmonster.png)

In this module you'll learn how to migrate a monolithic application to the cloud and how to fearlessly break it up into microservices. Therefore, we want to walk you through the different stages of identifying and extracting a microservice, as well as strangling it around its origin â€“ the monolith. For this purpose, the module provides step-by-step instructions and labs showing the best practices we have identified for migrating a monolith to the cloud. This module goes along with a blog post series, which you can find [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/fearless-monolith-to-microservices-migration-a-guided-journey/). Please take a look at the different blog posts to learn more about certain migration steps.
