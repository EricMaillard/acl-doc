# Preparation for keptn

Before we can install keptn and deploy an application with it, there are a couple of steps we have to take

## Step 1: Create a new organization for the carts service
We will be deploying carts as part of the workshop. However, this is a slightly different version of the original carts application so it is best to create a dedicated `Github organization` for it in github. The name is not important. Make sure to keep note of it. More information can be found [here](../../04_Building_Environment_zero/1_Gathering_Facts/github_org.md)
