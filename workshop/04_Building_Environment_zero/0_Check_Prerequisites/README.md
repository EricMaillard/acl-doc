# Check Prerequisites

## Data needed
* Credentials for bastion host (Will be provided via Etherpad)
* Access to the Dynatrace Tenant provided for the lab. 
Note: Dynatrace Tenant should preferably be on Sprint or Production environments as certain functionality like tagging and custom properties can be unstable/limited on DEV Tenants.
* A Github account

## Verifying the bastion

1. If you haven't received your user credentials and connection information for the bastion host, please reach out to one of the instructors.

1. Use your ssh client to connect to the bastion host and ensure the ```kubectl``` is configured for your GKE cluster.

    ```
    (local)$ ssh <username>@<bastion-ip>
    ```

    When asked, please provide the password and you should be connected to a terminal at the bastion host.

1. Check the `kubectl` configuration
    ```
    (bastion)$ kubectl config view
    ```

    The output should look similiar to the following image, where (1) should be the name of your cluster, and (2) is the generated access token.

    ![kubectl config view](../assets/kubectl-config-view.png)

    Also, be sure the current context is set to the gcloud cluster. It should look as follows.

    ![kube context](../assets/kubecontext.png)

    If not, execute the following for your cluster:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context <your-gke-cluster-name>
    ```

    ```
    (bastion)$ kubectl get namespaces
    ```
    The output should look similiar to the following image.

    ![kubectl get namespaces](../assets/kubectl-get-namespaces.png)
